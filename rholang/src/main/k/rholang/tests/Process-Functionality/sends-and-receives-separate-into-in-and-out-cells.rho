// Sending/Receiving
// A send is put into an <out /> cell, and a receive/listen is put into a <in /> cell.

// You can experiment with non-deterministic behavior via
//   kompile rho.k --transition "outcreation, increation"
//   krun parallel\ processes.rho --search
// (see Lesson 3 of imp++ on the K framework online tutorial)
// This will show you the order in which K matched the pattern on each
// of the sends/receives, visible in the InData for each of the cells.

// There should be n! solutions, where n is the number of sends or receives (i.e. this gives 4 = 2! solutions)

@Nil!("Send Success") | for( x <- @"Receive Success" ){ Nil }
