## Patterns

- A patterns is more general than a process
- A process can be thought of as a pattern that only matches to one thing
- Explains syntax fully

### Collection patterns
- List pattern
  - `Hd`, `Tl`
  - Examples
- Set pattern
  - `Hd`, `Tl`
  - Examples

### Simple types

### `~` Pattern

### Logical `\/` and `/\`

### A name pattern
- Just a quoted process pattern

### A process is a pattern that matches only one process

### Process equivalence
- Alpha equivalence
- Commutativity around `|`
- Any extra `Nil`s


## Pattern Matching

- Pattern matching rules from matching tutorial document, made more precise/technical
  - Actually fully fleshes *everything* out
- Exposition of `match` goes here? Or gets its own thing?
  - If it does, where do we talk about pattern matching in `for`?

### `match`



## A Type Theoretic Approach
- AST Types
- Matching is an inclusion predicate
