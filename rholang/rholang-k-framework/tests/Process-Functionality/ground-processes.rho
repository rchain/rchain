// In Rholang, ground processes include expressions and the empty process Nil
// Ground processes *at the top level* evaluate to the empty process and are equivalent to the empty process.
// However, one should note that ground processes are not in general semantically equivalent.
// For example, the channels @10 and @Nil are not the same. Only at the top level are we guaranteed that
// they will behave similarly.


// Test:
// Since ground processes evaluate to the empty process at the top level, if G is a ground process and P is a process,
// then P | G should evaluate to P. Like wise, for G_1, ... , G_n ground processes, P | G_1 | ... | G_n = P

@Nil!("success") | "fails if you see anything but the send" | 10 | Nil


// Arithmetic operations are not yet implemented in the framework; we should be able to add, for example,
//    | 10 + 5
// to this test in the future.
