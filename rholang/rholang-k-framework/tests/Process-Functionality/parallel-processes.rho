// If P1 and P2 are processes, Rholang executes P1 | P2 by running both processes simultaneously, which
// allows for all sorts of interesting behavior.
// This test will succeed if two sends are executed (simultaneously), each sending "success" over @Nil

// You can experiment with non-determinism via
//   kompile rho.k --transition "outcreation"
//   krun parallel\ processes.rho --search
// (see Lesson 3 of imp++ on the K framework online tutorial)
// This will show you the order in which K matched the pattern on each of the sends,
// visible in the InData for each of the cells.

@Nil!("success0") | @Nil!("success1") | @Nil!("success2")

// The test succeeds if all three channels execute individually, resulting in three <out> cells.
