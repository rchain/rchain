# Mainnet Feature Requirements

## Peer to Peer Network
### As a Node operator, I want to be able to bootstrap to the network by connecting to any known node
### As a Node operator, once connected via a bootstrap node, I want to discover and connect to peers
### As a Node operator, I want to know how many peers I am connected to
## Network Launch
### As a Coop SRE I want to launch a network
#### A succesful genesis ceremony 
##### test: not available
##### steps:

* `ceremonyMaster` is instatantied with flags `--required-sigs 2 --duration 5min --interval 10sec --bonds-file <holds two nodes validatorA and validatorB`.
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` joins p2p, both pointing to `ceremonyMaster` as bootstrap
* `ceremonyMaster` sends `UnapprovedBlock` to `validatorA` and `validatorB`
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` receives `UnapprovedBlock`
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` send back `BlockApproval`
* `ceremonyMaster` transitions to `ApprovedBlockReceivedHandler`
* `ceremonyMaster` sends `ApprovedBlock` to `validatorA` and `validatorB`
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` transition to ApprovedBlockReceivedHandler
* `ceremonyMaster`, `validatorA` and `validatorB` tip points to block (genesis) where it has no parent and Bonds holds `validatorA` and `validatorB`

#### A succesful genesis ceremony with read-only nodes joining 
##### test: not available
##### steps:

* `ceremonyMaster` is instatantied with flags `--required-sigs 2 --duration 5min --interval 10sec --bonds-file <holds two nodes validatorA and validatorB`.
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` joins p2p, both pointing to `ceremonyMaster` as bootstrap
* `readOnlyA`(read-only) joins p2p
* `ceremonyMaster` sends `UnapprovedBlock` to `validatorA` and `validatorB`
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` receives `UnapprovedBlock`
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` send back `BlockApproval`
* `ceremonyMaster` transitions to `ApprovedBlockReceivedHandler`
* `ceremonyMaster` sends `ApprovedBlock` to `validatorA` and `validatorB`
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` transition to ApprovedBlockReceivedHandler
* `ceremonyMaster`, `validatorA` and `validatorB` tip points to block (genesis) where it has no parent and Bonds holds `validatorA` and `validatorB`
* `readOnlyA` **never** transitions to `ApprovedBlockReceivedHandler`


#### A NOT succesful genesis ceremony (not enough sigs)
##### test: not available
##### steps:

* `ceremonyMaster` is instatantied with flags `--required-sigs 3 --duration 5min --interval 10sec --bonds-file <holds two nodes validatorA and validatorB`.
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` joins p2p, both pointing to `ceremonyMaster` as bootstrap
* `ceremonyMaster` sends `UnapprovedBlock` to `validatorA` and `validatorB`
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` receives `UnapprovedBlock`
* `validatorA` and `validatorB` send back `BlockApproval`
* `ceremonyMaster` logs an error about not getting enough signatures on time (`duration`)

#### A validator catching up after ceremony
##### test: not available
##### steps:

* genesis reached as described in "A succesful genesis ceremony"
* `validatorC` joins p2p, pointing on `ceremonyMaster` as bootstrap
* `validatorC` sends `ApprovedBlockRequest` to `ceremonyMaster`
* `ceremonyMaster` sends `ApprovedBlock` to `validatorC`
* `validatorC` transitions to `ApprovedBlockReceivedHandler`
* `validatorC` tip points to block (genesis) where it has no parent and Bonds holds `validatorA` and `validatorB`

## Bonding/Unbonding
### As a Node Validator, I want to be able to add my stake to the network and be recognized as a validator so I can participate in proof of stake consensus and be eligible to earn rewards (validating)
### As a Node Validator, I want to be able to retrieve my stake from the network and no longer be recognized a as validator
## Proof of stake consensus
### As a dApp developer I want to be able to deploy my rholang contract to a validator
#### A correct contract gets deployed successfully
##### test: not available
##### steps:

* instantiate p2p network with single `ceremonyMaster` that transitions to `ApprovedBlockReceivedhandler` (`--required-sig 0`)
* call `rnode deploy` with `rholang/examples/tut-philosophers.rho` on `ceremonyMaster`
* assert a success on std out
* `rnode deploy` exit code should be 0

#### An incorrect  contract does not get deployed 
##### test: not available
##### steps:

* instantiate p2p network with single `ceremonyMaster` that transitions to `ApprovedBlockReceivedhandler` (`--required-sig 0`)
* call `rnode deploy` with invalid contract on `ceremonyMaster`
* assert a error logs on std out
* `rnode deploy` exit code should be 1
