;; Simple test harness. This needs improvement.

;; One test is whether macro expansion still works.
;;
;; Here's what I'm going for:
;;
;; CL-USER> (defmacro test-form (form answer)
;;            `(let ((result ,form))
;;               (if (equal result ,answer)
;;                   (format t "Form ~A = ~A passed.~%" ',form ,answer)
;;                   (format t "Form ~A = ~A failed (produced ~A).~%" ',form ,answer result))))
;; TEST-FORM
;; CL-USER> (test-form (+ 1 2) 3)
;; Form (+ 1 2) = 3 passed.
;; NIL
;; CL-USER> (test-form (+ 1 2) 4)
;; Form (+ 1 2) = 4 failed (produced 3).
;; NIL

(define successes 0)
