    *   Validators are producing blocks on top of the genesis, but there are not enough blocks exchanged in the network,

    *   length of genesis ceremony. If genesis is out of the view of latest messages and no finalization fringe found,
    *   this is a reason to declare genesis ceremony failed.
    * 2. Silent validator. Safety oracle complexity puts a constraint on how long Casper can tolerate validator not
    *   producing blocks. If validator is silent for long enough - at some point his latest message becomes out of the
    *   view of other latest messages, therefore cannot be finalized. This means finalization fringe cannot be completed.
    *   This might cause a network halt, or some reaction to such silent validator.
    *
    * For now, as in general traversing through justifications should not be heavy task, and can be cached,
    * it is suggested to just relax maxDepth, up tp Long.MaxValue.
