Script to make a pull request.

To use this script you need to install PyGitHub:
pip install PyGitHub

A typicall workflow with this script:

1) Initiate repository with:

        ./pr.py project init

   This will create a new branch in format: dev-<username>-<featureName> and initiate script's config file with some variables.

2) Once you made some changes you can commit them with:

        ./pr.py project commit

   This will commit your changes using git and add some service info to the commit message to trigger smart commits and change JIRA's ticket status to `InProgress`. 

3) Do some additional changes and commit them using git.

4) Push changes to the `origin` and create PR to `remote` (possibly it would be the original repo you forked from) using:

        ./pr.py project pr create

5) Review PR and push additional changes if necessary

6) Merge PR using:

       ./pr.py project pr merge

   This will merge last created PR and also add some service information to the commit message to trigger smart commits and change JIRA's ticket status to `InProgress`. 

7) Done!
