/**
  * Block can be recorded as last finalized block (LFB) if Safety oracle outputs fault tolerance (FT)
  * for this block greater then some predefined threshold. This is defined by [[CliqueOracle.computeOutput]]
  * function, which requires some target block as input arg.
  *
  * Therefore: Finalizer has a scope of search, defined by tips and previous LFB - each of this blocks can be next LFB.
  *
  * We know that LFB advancement is not necessary continuous, next LFB might not be direct child of current one.
  *
  * Therefore: we cannot start from current LFB children and traverse DAG from the bottom to the top, calculating FT
  * for each block. Also its computationally ineffective.
  *
  * But we know that scope of search for potential next LFB is constrained. Block A can be finalized only
  * if it has more then half of total stake in bonds map of A translated from tips throughout main parent chain.
  * IMPORTANT: only main parent relation gives weight to potentially finalized block.
  *
  * Therefore: Finalizer should seek for next LFB going through 2 steps:
  *   1. Find messages in scope of search that have more then half of the stake translated through main parent chain
  *     from tips down to the message.
  *   2. Execute [[CliqueOracle.computeOutput]] on these targets.
  *   3. First message passing FT threshold becomes the next LFB.
