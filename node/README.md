# RChain Node

## 1. Overview

At the moment, you can execute node in three separate modes: 

1. REPL
2. EVAL
3. P2P

In REPL mode users have the ability to execute Rho-lang commands in a REPL environment, which will be evaluated by the Rho-lang interpreter. Note that at the moment - in REPL mode - no node-to-node communication is possible.

EVAL mode allows users run Rholang that is stored in a plain text file (filename.rho). In this mode the node wil lmake a directory on the local system available to the interpreter as a location where Rholang contracts can be executed.

In P2P mode, node will instantiate a peer-to-peer network. It will either connect to some already existing node in the network (called bootstrap node) or will create a new network (essentailly acting as bootstrap node).

## 2. Building

### Building from source

#### Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8
    - We recommend using the OpenJDK 
    - Alternatively, the [Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) is an option
* [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)
* For crypto, the [Sodium crypto library](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium)
* For Rholang
    - [CUP](http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/install.php) 0.11b-2014-06-11 or later. See [Rholang README](https://github.com/rchain/rchain/blob/master/rholang/README.md) for notes on installation requirements.
     - [jflex](http://jflex.de/)
     - Build [BNFC](http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/) from the following commit or later: [BNFC/bnfc@7c9e859](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/commit/7c9e859)
      
#### Node depends on the following subprojects: 

1. comm
2. crypto
3. rholang
4. storage

Building some of them is just a matter of `sbt compile`, however some (like `rholang` or `crypto`) require extra steps to build. See README.md of each subproject for details.

Once you can build each subproject individually, run `sbt node/assembly` to build an executable. The assembled jar will be available under `./node/target/scala-2.12/rnode-assembly-x.y.z.jar`

Example

```scala
sbt:rchain> node/assembly
[info] Including: JLex.jar
[info] Including: log4s_2.12-1.4.0.jar
[info] Including: java-cup-11b-runtime.jar

(...)

[info] Done packaging.
[success] Total time: 25 s, completed Mar 26, 2018 3:36:09 PM
```

### Building via Docker

The only Docker combination that has been extensively tested is

```
Client:
 Version:      17.09.1-ce
 API version:  1.32
 Go version:   go1.8.3
 Git commit:   19e2cf6
 Built:        Thu Dec  7 22:24:28 2017
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64

Server:
 Version:      17.09.1-ce
 API version:  1.32 (minimum version 1.12)
 Go version:   go1.8.3
 Git commit:   19e2cf6
 Built:        Thu Dec  7 22:23:07 2017
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
 Experimental: false
```

though others are expected to work.

#### Docker by itself

If you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, you can build a docker image. Under the covers, the docker build process is the `sbt` build process, exactly as described above. The command

```
docker build . -t rchain-comm:latest
```

will build an image tagged "latest" containing the jar file and a suitable entry point.

#### Docker via `sbt`

If the requirement for building via `sbt` are _also_ met, you can request that `sbt` build and tag docker images:

```
sbt docker
```

We recommend this method, as it is much quicker and builds a much slimmer image.

#### Testing that image is built and available

To test if image is available to use, simply run `docker images`, `coop.rchain/rnode` should be on the list of available images.

```
hideout:rchain rabbit$ docker images | grep rchain
coop.rchain/rnode                               latest              b1af7024d9bf        6 minutes ago       131MB
```

## 3. Running a Node

### 3.1 REPL mode

In REPL mode users have the ability to execute Rho-lang commands in REPL environment, which will be evaluated by the Rho-lang interpreter. Note that at the moment - in REPL mode - no node-to-node communication is possible

In order to execute node in REPL mode you need to run it with `--repl` flag. Note that in REPL mode all other flags will be ignored.

#### Running via Docker

By far the simplest way to run this code is by using Docker and the official image at Docker Hub. You can also [build docker image yourself](#building-via-docker) and then run it.

```
$ docker run -ti coop.rchain/rnode --repl
```

#### Running via Java

This will run Node from JAR file that was built in [Building from source](#building-from-source)

```
$ java -jar ./node/target/scala-2.12/rnode-assembly-0.1.3.jar --repl
> 
```

### 3.2 EVAL mode
In EVAL mode, node runs in the interpreter mode and supports running Rholang code that is stored in a plain text file.

### Running via Docker
By far the simplest way to run this code is by using Docker and the official image at Docker Hub. You can also [build docker image yourself](#building-via-docker) and then run it.

To run Rholang that is stored in a plain text file (filename.rho), use

'''
docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/file_directory,target=/tmp rchain/rnode --eval /tmp/filename.rho
'''

This command will run the node in interpreter mode and will make a directory on the local system available to the interpreter as a location where Rholang contracts can be executed. When running your docker container, be aware of your current path - the 'pwd' command sticks you current path in the bind command.

### 3.3 P2P mode

In P2P mode, node will instantiate a peer-to-peer network. It will either connect to some already existing node in the network (called bootstrap node) or will create a new network (essentailly acting as bootstrap node). Note that this release prints a great deal of diagnostic information. 

An RChain node is addressed by an "rnode address", which has the following form

```
rnode://<address-key>@<host-or-ip>:<udp-port>
```

This version generates (non-cryptographically) random address keys of 128 bits, or 32 characters (UUIDs,
essentially). Future releases will generate full-length 256- or 512-bit rnode addresses, but for demonstration purposes,
128 bits is about the limit of manageability.

By default - when run without any flag - the communication system attempts to connect itself to the test RChain network by bootstrapping from a known node in that network. 

Using flags you can specify which bootstrapping node should be used or if the node should create its own network (become a bootstrap node).


#### Running via Docker

By far the simplest way to run this code is by using Docker and the official image at Docker Hub. You can also [build docker image yourself](#building-via-docker) and then run it.

Note that the port used has to be mapped to the proper host port for the node to be able to advertise itself to the network
properly. This may happen automatically, and it may not; it completely depends on how your computer and network are configured. Some
monkeying with `docker run` options may be required, and the `--host` and `--port` options to this system may also help.

```

## 5. Miscellaneous

### 5.1. Host and Port

The system attempts to find a gateway device with Universal Plug-and-Play enabled. If that fails, the system tries to guess a good
IP address and a reasonable UDP port that other nodes can use to communicate with this one. If it does not guess a usable pair, they may be specified on the command line using the `--host` and `--port` options:

```
--host 1.2.3.4 --port 30304
```

By default it uses UDP port 30304. This is also how more than one node may be run on a single machine: just pick different
ports. Remember that if using Docker, ports may have to be properly mapped and forwarded. For example, if we want to connect on the
test net on UDP port 12345 and our machine's public IP address is 1.2.3.4, we could do it like so:

```
$ docker run -ti -p 12345:12345/udp rchain/rchain-comm:latest -p 12345 --host 1.2.3.4
```

or perhaps by causing docker to use the host network and not its own bridge:

```
$ docker run -ti --network=host rchain/rchain-comm:latest -p 12345
```

This may take some experimentation to find combinations of arguments that work for any given setup.

Read more than you want to know about Docker networking starting about
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/work-with-networks/), but honestly, it's featureful and powerful enough
that you need a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/wsargent/docker-cheat-sheet#exposing-ports).

### 5.2 Bootstrapping a Private Network

It is possible to set up a private RChain network by running a standalone node and using it for bootstrapping other nodes. Here we
run one on port 4000:

```
$ java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -jar /Users/rabbit/projects/rchain/node/target/scala-2.12/rnode-assembly-0.1.3.jar -s -p 4000
11:21:00.164 [main] INFO  main - uPnP: Some(/192.168.1.123) -> Some(93.158.233.123)
11:21:00.600 [kamon.prometheus.PrometheusReporter] INFO  kamon.prometheus.PrometheusReporter - Started the embedded HTTP server on http://0.0.0.0:9095
11:21:01.012 [main] INFO  o.h.b.c.nio1.NIO1SocketServerGroup - Service bound to address /127.0.0.1:8080
11:21:01.013 [main] INFO  org.http4s.server.blaze.BlazeBuilder -   _   _   _        _ _     
11:21:01.014 [main] INFO  org.http4s.server.blaze.BlazeBuilder -  | |_| |_| |_ _ __| | | ___
11:21:01.014 [main] INFO  org.http4s.server.blaze.BlazeBuilder -  | ' \  _|  _| '_ \_  _(_-<
11:21:01.014 [main] INFO  org.http4s.server.blaze.BlazeBuilder -  |_||_\__|\__| .__/ |_|/__/
11:21:01.014 [main] INFO  org.http4s.server.blaze.BlazeBuilder -              |_|
11:21:01.051 [main] INFO  org.http4s.server.blaze.BlazeBuilder - http4s v0.18.0 on blaze v0.12.11 started at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
11:21:01.121 [main] INFO  main - Listening for traffic on rnode://a96a6c152711416f869da7fe8c2ced61@192.168.1.123:4000.
11:21:01.122 [main] INFO  main - Starting stand-alone node.
```

Now bootstrapping the other node just means giving the argument

```
--bootstrap rnode://a96a6c152711416f869da7fe8c2ced61@192.168.1.123:4000
```

For example:

```
$ java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -jar /Users/rabbit/projects/rchain/node/target/scala-2.12/rnode-assembly-0.1.3.jar --bootstrap rnode://a96a6c152711416f869da7fe8c2ced61@192.168.1.123:4000 -p 4001 -x 8081
11:24:09.885 [main] INFO  main - uPnP: Some(/192.168.1.123) -> Some(93.158.233.123)

```

where bootstrapped node will log 

```

```

### 5.3 Metrics
The current version of the node produces metrics on some communications-related activities in Prometheus format. A local node and metrics visualizer may be started by following the instructions found [here](https://github.com/rchain/rchain/blob/master/docker/node/README.md).

### 5.4 Caveats

This is very much a work in progress. The networking overlay is only known to work when it can avail itself of visible IP addresses,
either public or all contained within the same network. It does not yet include any special code for getting around a home firewall
or a closed router, though it does contain some uPNP handling. Any port used must be open or mapped through the router. Depending on
your setup, it might be necessary to configure port-forwarding on your router. In some cases, it might even be necessary to specify
your router's public IP address as the node address if your router's port-forwarding requires it.
