  # Get RNode Docker image and run integration tests.
  # 
  # These steps are run directly on runner's host (note there's no container key
  # in the job configuration). That is because bind mounting in container runner
  # is broken[1] and we need to mount host's /tmp onto container's /tmp (see
  # "Running from Docker" in integration-tests/README.md). The host doesn't have
  # everything we need (pipenv, pyenv), so we're going to run integration tests
  # in rchain/buildenv container started manually as the last step.
  #
  # The problem is that host's runner runs everything under a non-privileged
  # account, whereas the rchain/buildenv container runs as root by default. The
  # container image does not have an account corresponding to the host's
  # unprivileged account UID, so we're going to run it as root and do some
  # workarounds (see below).
