    * There are 2 cases when the channel is considered conflicting.

    *   1. If the same produce or consume is destroyed in COMM in both branches, this might be a race.
    *   All events created in event logs are unique, this match can be identified by comparing case classes.
    *
    *   Produce is considered destroyed in COMM if it is not persistent and been consumed without peek.
    *   Consume is considered destroyed in COMM when it is not persistent.
    *
    *   2. Events that are created inside branch and has not been destroyed in branch's COMMs
    *   can lead to potential COMM during merge.
    *   NOTE: this case requires special care about peek, as active event can be inherited from base state because
    *   of peek issue.

    * @return set of channels that are conflicting.
